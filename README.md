Hello, 
it's me, Shahnaz Priya
you may call me "Priya", this is my personal blog, and everything i write here is all my own.

Theme is based on Hyde and two days of his hundred percent effort to edit this base theme to make it as user friendly as possible which includes printing and reading UI-UX articles, pondering around Dribble and Behance, requesting people to use their ideas on variouos design platforms, asking for help here and there, taking recommendations from friends and most importantly, by googling HTML and CSS basics.
